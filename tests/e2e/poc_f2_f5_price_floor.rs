//! Proof-of-concept regression test for finding **F2/F5** (free storage).
//!
//! ## The vulnerability (pre-fix)
//!
//! `verify_evm_payment` reconstructed the payment from the attacker's own
//! quotes and delegated the decision to `SingleNodePayment::verify`, which
//! accepts if **any quote tied at the median price** was paid 3× on-chain.
//! Combined with `validate_local_recipient` only checking that this node's
//! rewards address appears in *some* quote (`.any()`), an attacker could:
//!
//!  * **underprice**: submit 7 self-signed 1-atto quotes (one carrying our
//!    address) and pay a negligible 3 atto; and/or
//!  * **pay yourself**: include one quote with our address purely to pass the
//!    recipient check, but route the actual 3× on-chain payment to a quote
//!    whose `rewards_address` is the attacker's OWN wallet.
//!
//! Either way the attacker stores arbitrary data while this node earns
//! nothing — free storage. The single-node path has no DHT/identity binding.
//!
//! ## The fix — sound invariant
//!
//! `verify_evm_payment` now accepts only if there exists a quote `Q` where
//! ALL of: (a) `Q.rewards_address == this node's local_rewards_address`,
//! (b) `Q.price >= price_floor` (`calculate_price(records_stored)/TOL`, wired
//! live in production), and (c) on-chain `completedPayments(Q.hash) >= 3 *
//! Q.price`. (a)+(b) are checked on the SAME quote whose 3× payment is
//! verified in (c), so both the underpricing and pay-yourself primitives are
//! closed.
//!
//! These tests prove BOTH attack variants are now rejected, that an honest
//! fair payment to this node still passes the price/recipient gate, and
//! (flip) that without the recipient binding the pay-yourself proof would
//! sail past every pre-on-chain check.
